Xist	H2afy	RNA-Protein	Regulation	Mus musculus	These results demonstrate that Xist repression mainly affects macroH2A deposition, but not H3K27me3, on the Xi of pre-iPSCs.	Pluripotent Stem Cells	NULL	RNA FISH and Immunofluorescence Staining	24965076
Xist	Rlim	DNA-Protein	Binding	Mus musculus	Xist, a long non-coding RNA crucial for both forms of XCI, is activated by the ubiquitin ligase RLIM (also known as Rnf12).	mouse embryonic epiblast		RT-qPCR,RNA FISH and Immunohistochemical analysis 	24870238
Xist	Prdm14	DNA-Protein	Binding	Mus musculus	PRDM14 promotes XCR through repressing the Xist-activator Rnf12 and through Tsix-dependent binding to Xist intron 1	iPSCs and ESCs		Immunostainings and RNA-FISH	24268575
Xist	Tsix	RNA-RNA	Regulation	Mus musculus	At the onset of X inactivation, Tsix represses Xist accumulation in cis but does not restore random choice. These results identify for the first time a dual function for Tsix as both a repressor of the steady-state level of Xist expression and as a regulator of the distribution of Xist RNA within the nucleus.
