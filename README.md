# Introduction
lncRInter is reliable and high quality lncRNA interaction database containing experimentally validated data. The lncRNA interaction datasets are all extractd from peer-reviewed publications by our curators with strict criteria that there were certain experimental evidence (e.g. RNA pull-down, luciferase reporter assay, in vitro binding assay, etc.) for direct lncRNA interactions.
